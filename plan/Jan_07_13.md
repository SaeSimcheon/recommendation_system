# Todo
  1. Listing the papers about statistical approachs for recommendation system.
  2. Study Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 Recommender Systems :The Textbook Charu C. Aggarwal
  3. Along with 2, make a code example about movie in python.
  4. [Tutorials for Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) -> upload the code studied on other repo.
    -> Before start to analyze the day's task, give the topic which was studied yesterday and then complete the empty code.
