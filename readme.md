### In statistical approach and data mining

To January 08 2022, make a list of recommendation system paers.
From these perspectives,
- No deep learning.
- Several topics can be considered.

At 14:00 January 12 2022, topic and paper might be fixed.
When I find a good paper, upload the paper on google drive shared with professor.
